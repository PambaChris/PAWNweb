It appears your Git repository is corrupted, as indicated by the error: "error: object file .git/objects/ea/cb0655a95b5bae04817b5aba0177ef0da71c10 is empty fatal: unable to read eacb0655a95b5bae04817b5aba0177ef0da71c10".

This means I cannot perform any Git operations, including saving changes, committing, or pushing to GitHub.

To resolve this, you typically need to:
1.  Attempt to fix the repository using Git's own tools (e.g., `git fsck --full`, `git repack -ad`). This can sometimes be risky.
2.  Alternatively, the safest approach might be to manually save your current changes, delete the local repository, clone a fresh copy from GitHub, and then reapply your changes.

Since I cannot modify the Git repository in its current state, please let me know how you would like to proceed. I recommend backing up your current changes manually if you choose to fix the repository.
